    "Q.1 Case Study Description:\n",
    "You are assigned to develop a simple Employee Salary Management System for a company. The system needs to calculate the final salary of an employee based on their basic salary, allowances, and deductions.\n",
    "The company has the following rules:\n",
    "1.\tBasic Salary Calculation:\n",
    "The basic salary of an employee is given. From this, the system will calculate the total salary.\n",
    "2.\tAllowances:\n",
    "        o\tHouse Rent Allowance (HRA): 10% of the basic salary\n",
    "        o\tMedical Allowance (MA): 5% of the basic salary\n",
    "        o\tTransport Allowance (TA): 3% of the basic salary\n",
    "3.\tDeductions:\n",
    "        o\tTax Deduction: 12% of the basic salary\n",
    "        o\tProvident Fund (PF) Deduction: 5% of the basic salary\n",
    "4.\tFinal Salary Calculation:\n",
    "The final salary will be calculated as:\n",
    "Final Salary=Basic Salary+Total Allowances−Total Deductions\n",
    "The system needs to check whether the final salary is above $5000 or not. If it is, the employee gets a bonus of $200. Otherwise, they don’t get a bonus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "q3.\tWrite a Python program that accepts the basic salary and determines if the employee is eligible for a raise. The company offers a raise under the following conditions:\n",
    "        o\tIf the basic salary is less than $4000, the raise is 15% of the basic salary.\n",
    "        o\tIf the basic salary is between $4000 and $7000, the raise is 10%.\n",
    "        o\tIf the basic salary is above $7000, the raise is 5%.\n",
    "The program should print the new salary after applying the raise.\n",
    "\n",
    "q4.\tWrite a Python program to calculate the net salary (Final Salary + Bonus, if eligible) for N employees. \n",
    "        The program should take input for the number of employees and calculate and display the final salary for each employee, \n",
