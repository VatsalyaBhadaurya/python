    "A city wants to develop an AI-powered smart traffic light that adjusts signal timing based on vehicle density. The system follows these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "The road is divided into 4 lanes (North, South, East, West).\n",
    "Each lane has a sensor that counts the number of vehicles every 10 seconds.\n",
    "Traffic signal duration is adjusted dynamically based on vehicle count:\n",
    "High traffic (>50 vehicles) â†’ Green light for 40 seconds\n",
    "Moderate traffic (20-50 vehicles) â†’ Green light for 30 seconds\n",
    "Low traffic (<20 vehicles) â†’ Green light for 15 seconds\n",

    "If an ambulance is detected, the system immediately switches to a green light for that lane.\n",
    "The cycle repeats every minute.\n",

    "Write a Python program that simulates this smart traffic light system. It should take vehicle counts for 4 lanes and simulate traffic light control using loops and conditionals."
